- 👋 Hi, I’m @radumarg
- 👀 I’m interested in quantum computing and functional programming.
- 🌱 I’m have created on an open-source quantum computing platform named Uranium targeted for fast quantum algorithm research: https://uranium.transilvania-quantum.org/ and I am working on a functional programming language for quantum computing: https://github.com/radumarg/lambdaQ
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source software for quantum computing.
